# Fibonacci

Probably some general concepts of `computer sciences` can be explained in the simplest form using this example.
Generating `n` terms of [Fibonacci serries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) seems a trivial task. However, it can be used to show how the poor implementatiuon of algorithm for such a trivial problem could end up with scalability issues (in time and space).
